PHP Honeypot

For my cyber security class, I chose to perform an analysis of comment spam.
To do this, I built this honeypot in PHP. I linked it up from a bunch of
sites and examined the results.

Setup
-----

This is designed to be run in Interchange (~v0.2). Newer versions are likely
incompatible.

Also, a version of Cloud (circa early 2010) is required as a library.

Results
-------

After about two months of running, the data showed a few things. First, a good
number of spammers search Google for topics that would be postable. I don't
have any of the queries that were used, however, the honeypot did store the
keywords that were used on each page. Spambots did not target sites that
included common phrases such as, "Just another Wordpress weblog."

Another interesting finding was that an initial "probe" spider was often used
to find pages on a site, while other bots were sent to leave the spammy
comments. This is indicative of botnet activity.

From a technical standpoint, the bots were incapable of completing even the
simplest of tasks. For instance, requiring the bot to fill "orange" into a
textbox (even when the box is named "orange") proved too complex, despite
its popularity.

Bots will attempt to fill in any text field they are presented with. If the
field is not recognized, it is filled with random characters. If the field
is an email field, a randomly generated email address is created. I was not
able to collect enough information to detect a pattern in the email addresses
generated.
